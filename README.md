## Overview 
I've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, I've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.


## Technologies Used
This project leverages several technologies to process and analyze election data efficiently:

- **Python**: The core language used for scripting the analysis, providing robust support for data manipulation and file handling.
- **Pandas**: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, used to handle, clean, and analyze the school and student data effectively.
- **Matplotlib**: A comprehensive library used for generating plots, charts, and visual representations of the data, enhancing the readability of the analysis.
- **SciPy**: A library used for scientific and technical computing, particularly for performing statistical analysis and linear regression models.
- **NumPy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive computing environment that facilitates data exploration, visualization, and narrative analysis, making it easy to document and present findings.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Chosen as the preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding, debugging, and managing the project files.
- **GitHub**: Hosts the repository online, allowing for backup, sharing, and documentation hosting, including this README file.
